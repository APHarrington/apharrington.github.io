My husband made me do it. 

My name is Paige, and Iâ€™ve recently lost my spark.
I had the good fortune of landing a job right out of college. Unfortunately, this led to the loss of my starving artist need to write. 

Now, as I make my way through grad school, my husband is forcing me to get my groove back. Feel free to join me as I fumble through my thoughts, memories and experiences and put them into blogs, fiction and food.
